All data for feeding the dashboards can be found in `server/dataset.json`. It has the following shape

```json
{
  "traffic_data": [{
    "id": "c0281ed3-160d-4be0-acc7-1dd9a62a4f78",
    "url": "https://www.example.com/article1",
    "author": "Maximilian",
    "image_url": "https://picsum.photos/600/400?buster=0.4005155557173643",
    "geo": "IT",
    "daily_traffic": [{
      "day": 1,
      "hourly_traffic": [{
        "hour": 0,
        "traffic": 743
      }, {
        "hour": 1,
        "traffic": 149
      }, {
        "hour": 2,
        "traffic": 546
      }, {
        "hour": 3,
        "traffic": 812
      }, ...
      {
        "hour": 23,
        "traffic": 768
      }]
    }, ...
    {
      "day": 31,
      "hourly_traffic": [{
        "hour": 0,
        "traffic": 143
      }, ...
      {
        "hour": 23,
        "traffic": 448
      }]
    }]
  }]
